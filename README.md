# Helixscript
Helixscript is a lightweight scripting language based from java 17. It is a simple language that will be extended as I work on it slowly. I am open to suggestions of keywords or what some things might do or make. 

## Improvements to Helixscript
Suggestions will be accepted

### Language differences 
Suggestions such as what keyword to take from another language:
python = print("Hello!")
js = console.log("Hello!");
rust = println!("Hello!"); 
ruby = puts "Hello!"
php = echo "Hello!";
haskell = putStrLn "Hello!"
malbolge = ('&%:9]!~}|z2Vxwv-,POqponl$Hjig%eB@@<`
etc.

### Improvements 
make the `math` keyword:

a. int result = 3 + 7;
b. let result = 3 + 7;
c. result := 3 + 7
d. val result = 3 + 7
e. ('&%:9]!~}|z2Vxwv-,POqp3NlF.Jh++FdbCBA@?]!~|<`

change the variable keyword from `int` to:

i. let integer: number = 4;
ii. integer <- 4
iii. val integer = 4
iv. let integer = 4
v. ('&%:9]!~}|z2Vxwv-,POqp3NlF.Jh++FdbCBA@?]!~|<`

### Elaboration
